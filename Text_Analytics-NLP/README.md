# Text Analytics
This group of projects uses mainly `Python`, `Tensorflow\Keras` and other NLP toolkits to explore both traditional and modern techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.

## ðŸ§® Statistical Language Models
This project focuses on developing statistical language models for **auto-completing** sentences and **spellchecking**, using n-grams and Lidstone smoothing. It includes data preprocessing, vocabulary construction, and probability estimation. Key aspects are the use of bigram and trigram models, their evaluation via cross-entropy and perplexity, and their application in auto-completion and context-aware spelling correction. The results highlight the trade-offs between bigram and trigram models in terms of coherence, fluency, and error rates, with bigrams performing better in some aspects due to n-gram sparsity in trigrams.

## ðŸš€ Neural Networks and Deep Learning
A series of mini-projects aim to tackle the problems of **sentiment analysis** and **part-of-speech tagging** initially using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, and incrementally improving the results by replacing them with CNN, RNN and Transformer classifiers. Employing the [IMDB Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) for sentiment analysis and the [English-GUM](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_English-GUM) dataset from Universal Dependencies treebanks for part-of-speech tagging, the results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models.
